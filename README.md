This is a management system that deals with one user set submitting requests and the other reviewing those requests
thus it can be repurposed for systems such as "lost and found", "carpooling", and "ideas/topics review"

It is build using HTML, CSS, PhP and Java_Script with mySQL used for the database.

The database provided goes into \\localhost on phpmyadmin// for out of the box functionality... Change the conn string to your system setup otherwise
